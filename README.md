# League of Legends Skins Database

[![pt-br](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-pt--br-green.svg)](https://github.com/koobzaar/lol-skins/blob/master/README.pt-br.md)

> **If any skin crash / doesn't start your game, PLEASE, submit an issue to this repository. There's too many skins and we're not capable of testing everything.**

Generated using [ritoskin](https://github.com/nylish/ritoskin), from [nylish](https://github.com/nylish), this repository aims to provide a centralized and easily accessible location for all in-game skins available for League of Legends. The skins are offered in formats compatible with custom skin applications.

The purpose of this project is not to undermine the custom skin scene within League of Legends. Instead, we aim to provide a solution for players who have been unable to afford skins since the introduction of Vanguard. Previously, these players relied on tools like LolSkin or R3nzSkin, which are no longer viable.

Using custom skins does not confer any competitive advantage, as they are only visible to the player utilizing them.

The creator of this repository believes that with the implementation of predatory practices in skin sales — exemplified by exclusive skins like the Faker skin, which cost as much as three months' wages in some regions — Riot has restricted access to certain content for a significant portion of its player base.

> We hold that gaming culture should be inclusive and accessible, not just a privilege for those who can afford it.

Exalted is our private tool that works by loading a catalog of skins from our [lol-skins-developer](https://github.com/koobzaar/lol-skins-developer) repository allowing you to browse through a wide variety of options for each champion, and then injecting your chosen skin into the game.

- One click injection. Choose your champion then choose your skin. That's it.
- Always up-to-date catalog. Don't need to be browsing lol-skins everyday. New skin available? It will automatically appear in Exalted.
- **See your friends skins**. Sync your friends skins and yours with the party mode. Create a Party, invite your friends and choose your skin. Simple as that.
- Use your favorite map with your skin. Yeah, you can do this already. But it's simpler than you think.
- Your friends doesn't need to buy a copy of Exalted - you are free to share with them.
- You can get it **FOR FREE** by helping us with the skins. Check the pinned issue and the pinned message on our Discord server (#general-chat)
