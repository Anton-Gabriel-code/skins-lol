We currently have 220/1727 skins

## Overview

This repository aims to provide a centralized and easily accessible location for all in-game skins available for League of Legends. The skins are offered in formats compatible with custom skin applications, allowing players to enhance their gaming experience.

## Downloading all skins (.fantome files)

 - [CSLOL](https://github.com/LeagueToolkit/cslol-manager)

Follow the installation instructions provided with these tools to successfully implement the skins.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is not to undermine the custom skin scene within League of Legends. Instead, we aim to provide a solution for players who have been unable to afford skins since the introduction of Vanguard. Previously, these players relied on tools like LolSkin or R3nzSkin, which are no longer viable.

Using custom skins does not confer any competitive advantage, as they are only visible to the player utilizing them. The creator of this repository, and only him, believes that with the implementation of predatory practices in skin sales — exemplified by exclusive skins like the Faker skin, which cost as much as three months' wages in some regions — Riot has restricted access to certain content for a significant portion of its player base. We hold that gaming culture should be inclusive and accessible, not just a privilege for those who can afford it.
